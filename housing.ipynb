    "My hypothesis is that the best performing model overall will be the Random Forest Regressor with some kind of feature selection algorithm.  I think the Random Forest model will score better overall due to it being a more sophisticated model as compared to Linear Regression.  And I believe feature selection will further improve the performance as it will help prevent the Random Forest model from overfitting the training data."
